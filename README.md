![Application Icon](resources/images/icon.png)

## Summary
Narrative Director is an alternative Audio/Video Recording application tailored for working on medium to large-sized projects.
This tool aspires to keep editing to a minimum with the capability of playing, recording and re-recording readings in place at
the paragraph level for some text piece, whether it's a script, or a novel.

The Rust Edition serves as a successor to the [Qt 5 edition of Narrative Director](https://github.com/divark/narrative-director), in
addition to having an excuse to learn about writing GUI applications using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and 
[FLTK](https://github.com/fltk-rs/fltk-rs).

- Read paragraph-by-paragraph (4 sentences) from UTF-8 text files.
